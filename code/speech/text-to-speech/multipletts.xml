        It's such a nice weather today. Oh, it's Elizabeth by the way.

    <voice name="en-US-AmberNeural">
        Perfect. We're all here - shall we begin?

        Where did we leave off last time?
    </voice>
    <voice name="en-US-BrandonNeural">
        I think we managed to share the report with the customer.
    </voice>
    <voice name="en-US-AshleyNeural">
        And what was their feedback? Was it positive?
    </voice>
    <voice name="en-US-ElizabethNeural">
        They outlined a few concerns but overall it was very positive.

        They did mention they would like a follow up meeting to cover the Machine Learning part.
    </voice>
    <voice name="en-US-AshleyNeural">
        Sounds good. We can certainly accommodate that. Brandon is our resident ML expert.

        Brandon, can we run an overview session of our ML offerings on Azure?
    </voice>
    <voice name="en-US-BrandonNeural">
        Certainly. I can prepare an overview of our Azure Machine Learning offering and also cover the Cognitive Services. 

        Do we know the timelines we need to work against?
